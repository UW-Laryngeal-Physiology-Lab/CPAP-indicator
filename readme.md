# CPAP Subject Timer #
## Directions ##
This program is built for 8 trials of 10 x (5s on, 3s off) phonation for the CPAP project. If you wish to modify the timings, you will need to change the arument you pass the time() function in index.js. 

If you want to change the number of trials, you will have to change the logic tree inside index.js to have the appropriate number so the program knows when to switch logic paths.
